# '.config' folder?

In case if you were wondering, I made my config files setup with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) and have done documentations on each program.

So it means there are other files than pure configurations in _config_ directory but if you are comfortable with copying _config files_ to your own _.config_ folder, you can use this area.

Note that **installation commands** that were brought to you in main _README.md_ will make you the same files as here in this directory for your own _.config_ directory which means you can use both of them.
