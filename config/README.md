In this area you can easily find out about each application, its documantation and other stuff that I thought would be useful.

For full documantation you should refer to each program's own directory and read "README.md" of them.

Use *short links* for a fast way for going to your destination.

### Short Links
- [Main Menu](./../../../)
- [i3 window manager](./i3)
- [Kitty Terminal Emulator](./kitty)
- [Lightdm Display Manager](./lightdm)
- [Qbittorrent UI Theme](./qbittorrent)
- [Qute Web Browser](./qutebrowser)
- [GTK Theme + Icon Pack](./themes)
- [Wallpapers](./wallpaper)
